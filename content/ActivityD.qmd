### Satellite Communication: 

We will install additional hardware and pay a monthly fee to use Starlink on OMAO platforms for scientific purposes. We will demonstrate a use case in the IRA period, after which leadership can evaluate the utility of continuing to fund high-bandwidth satellite communication to deployed acoustic instruments and near real time data sharing.
