title: AA SI Activities
---

We have four unique but related activities within the AA SI, each focusing on a different aspect of our vision:

### Activity A: Echo Classification
Develop advanced analytical methods for echo classification

### Activity B: Validated Data
Assemble training datasets from validated, historical echo sounder and co-variate data

### Activity C: Cloud Storage and Computing
Procure cloud storage and computing

### Activity D: Satellite Communications
Procure high-bandwidth satellite communications

### Finally, we aim to continue testing, refining, and implementing these automated echo classification tools in support of reducing bias and improving efficiencies in NOAA Fisheries stock assessments
