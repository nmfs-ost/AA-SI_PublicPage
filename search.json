    "text": "Develop advanced analytical methods for echo classification\nEcho classification is the process of assigning acoustic backscatter to a category that is meaningful to the person using the data. Classification ideally assigns backscatter to species-level taxa, but includes classification to lower taxonomic-levels, trophic levels, or acoustic scattering types. Routine processes developed at each Science Center are still time consuming and not directly transferable to automated, real-time decision making that could greatly improve survey capabilities using autonomous platforms, and they do not currently take full advantage of emerging sources of wide-bandwidth technology across a full spectrum from low-frequencies to echosounders to acoustic-cameras. We will revolutionize echo classification by developing processing techniques and building a cloud-based framework that will promote development and implementation of advanced analytical methods to classify backscatter to the lowest taxonomic level possible in near-real time.",

The AA-SI will work primarily with Kongsberg EK echosounders and data, but there are other echosounder manufacturers whose data we may use. We will update this site as we add other data sources.\n\nEK80\nThe EK80 is the latest in the Kongsberg line of scientific echosounders. All NOAA FSVs and ships that have scientific echosounders collect data using the EK80. “EK80” refers to the echosounder (hardware that generates an electrical signal that is transmitted to the acoustic transducer and receives an electrical signal (voltage) that is then digitized and sent to the acquisition software, also known as “EK80”. The EK80 has several echosounders that can be used. The shipboard echosounder is called a Wide-Band Transceiver (WBT), and portable units are WBT-Tubes or WBATs (Wide-Band Autonomous Transceivers).\n\n\nEK60\nThe EK60 is the previous generation scientific echosounder. It was introduced in the late 1990s, and was installed on NOAA ships in the early 2000s. The majority of historic data collected by NOAA is from the EK60. The echosounder was called the General Purpose Transceiver (GPT) and the data acquisition software was called “ER60”. The EK80 software can control both WBTs and GPTs. Which software, ER60 or EK80, recorded the data is important to distinguish because the digital format of the data are different depending on software version.\n\n\nEK500\nThe EK500 was used from the 1980s (1970s?) until the early 2000s on NOAA ships.

    "text": "Assemble training datasets from validated, historical echosounder and co-variate data (FY24-FY26)\nDeveloping advanced analytical methods for echo classification requires high-quality, validated (accurately attributed to lowest taxonomic level) acoustic data and associated co-variate data. Most Centers have accumulated these data for stock assessment, but not in formats that are useful for input to advanced analytical models. In addition, co-variate data (e.g., oceanographic data, eDNA, optics, net catches, life history) and acoustical characteristics of species of interest are critical to improving the effectiveness of echo classification.\nValidated acoustic data can be obtained from empirical observations and theoretical scattering models. Empirical observations consist of acoustic data synchronized and co-located with net catches, optical images, or other samples of the origins of acoustic backscatter. Theoretical scattering models provide species-specific predicted backscatter and target strength that are used to confirm empirical observations over a wide range of environmental conditions, anatomical features, and acoustic frequency spectra. We will assemble example training datasets from pre-existing data sources that includes ancillary data used for acoustic validation, which will form the basis for developing advanced analytical methods for echo classification.",
