### What to expect in the first 1 to 7 days

Patience is key in the first week. Having to go through approvals, appointments and introductions during your initial days may be overwhelming and delays getting fully onboarded are expected. However, as each day passes you will get your NOAA credentials - which will get you access to the building, your NOAA computer and then sort through the necessary access to servers, and get up to speed on the acoustic data you'll be working with at NOAA and CIRES. There are required training courses from CU and NOAA that you will take online (see below) and several CU forms to complete that the CU team will walk you through.

In short, It's a lot of paperwork, learning, waiting, and a bit of doing.

### What to expect in the first month

As access to all things NOAA and CIRES are worked out, you should be well on your way to learning the tasks of the job, feeling integrated with the team and meeting others in the office.

Throughout this month, you will be given a lot of information and finding ways to document it, organize, and reference it will be very beneficial. The team has a couple of tools along with existing documentation - your help using these tools, providing feedback for what could be better, and additional information that is needed are always appreciated.

Hopefully be able to start doing your job :)))

### Things to configure

Here are some onboarding guidelines so you know you are on the right track: [Onboarding Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCmSwokU0IKdIqUIcqaIzvr2q3K0XeuAtINpWlVVNQw/edit?usp=sharing)

Another aspect of being a NOAA employee includes updating your timesheet in GovTA.

Instructions for configuration can be found here: [Timesheet setup for Students](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nrxWaun2OK8dSWKtI2cr7XIeCFyVXVYA/view?usp=sharing)

### Training

As a NOAA and CU Employee, there will also be several training courses that you will be required to complete:

NOAA training: NOAA IT Security Awareness

NOAA training: Records Management Course 101

CU training: Discrimination and Harassment

CU training: Introduction to Export Controls

# NOAA Enterprise GitHub

The AA-SI GitHub site is public, but to work with the site (e.g., edit pages) a person needs to have a NOAA GitHub Enterprise License.
To start, follow this [link](https://github.com/enterprises/noaa-nmfs) to fill out the request form, learn more about NOAA GitHub Enterprise Licenses, and find out Center-specific procedures. 

For example, at the **NEFSC**, the enterprise licenses are managed by the IT division. To get an enterprise license submit a helpdesk ticket. You can submit a general ticket, or click on "Applications" on the left, and then "GitHub Support Request" on the right for a potentially quicker response.
