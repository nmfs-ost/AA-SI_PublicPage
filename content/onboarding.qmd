### What to expect in the first 1 to 7 days

As you get onboarded through NOAA and/or a Cooperative Institute (CI) or contractor, you will have to go through numerous approvals, appointments and introductions during your initial days. This may feel overwhelming, and there may be delays getting fully onboarded. Have patience! As each day passes you will make progress getting your NOAA credentials setup - these will give you access to the building, your NOAA computer, necessary network servers, VPN, and other networks and websites. You will also start to get up to speed on the acoustic data you'll be working with. There are several required training courses that you will need to take online (see below) and, for CI hires, several Cooperative Institute forms to complete that the team will walk you through.

In short, It's a lot of paperwork, learning, waiting, and a bit of doing.

### What to expect in the first month

As access to all things NOAA and CI are worked out, you should be well on your way to learning the tasks of the job, feeling integrated with the team and meeting others in the office and virtually.

Throughout this month, you will be given a lot of information, so finding ways to document it, organize it, and reference it will be very beneficial. The team has a couple of tools along with existing documentation - your help using (and testing) these tools, providing feedback for what could be better, and additional information that is needed are always appreciated.


### Things to configure

Here are some onboarding guidelines so you know you are on the right track: [Onboarding Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12mKm5L2QYG5KNq3BLzqmOghY_q5v30HjlCyDKJd1-k8/edit?usp=sharing). Work with the NOAA Fisheries representatives, IT team, and others involved with your onboarding process to ask questions, clarify the process, and provide updates as steps are completed.

### Training

As a NOAA affiliate, there are several training courses that you need to complete:

-   NOAA training: NOAA IT Security Awareness

-   NOAA training: Records Management Course 101

-   CI training: Discrimination and Harassment

-   CI training: Introduction to Export Controls

-   Each CI may have different required trainings; work with your NOAA POC to ensure they are completed in a timely fashion.

# NOAA Enterprise GitHub

The AA-SI GitHub site is public, but to access the [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/nmfs-ost/repositories?q=AA) (e.g., view, push/pull) a person needs to have a NOAA GitHub Enterprise License. To start, follow this [link](https://github.com/enterprises/noaa-nmfs) to fill out the request form, learn more about NOAA GitHub Enterprise Licenses, and find out Science Center-specific procedures.
