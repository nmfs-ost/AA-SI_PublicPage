The goal of the Active Acoustics Strategic Initiative (AA-SI) includes organizing and standardizing multi-frequency and wide-bandwidth echosounder data to enable efficient data processing and analysis in a cloud environment. This is a summary and links to additional background information on how active acoustics are used to study fish and zooplankton in the ocean, the types of equipment commonly deployed to collect the data, common data formats, and requirements for data standardization.

## Active Acoustic Data Applications within NOAA

NOAA Fisheries is charged with conducting stock assessments of commercially-important species of fish, and frequently uses acoustic-trawl survey methods to accomplish this.

## Acoustic Instruments

Scientific echosounders record data to manufacturer-specified binary formats. The AA-SI works primarily with Kongsberg EK echosounders and data, but there are other echosounder manufacturers whose data we may use. We will update this site as we add other data sources.

In addition to the active acoustic data, we will work with annotations, metadata, and contextual data, such as biological, oceanographic, meteorological, and other benthic and pelagic habitat data.

### EK80

The [EK80](https://www.kongsberg.com/discovery/ocean-science/ek-family/ek80/) is the latest in the Kongsberg line of scientific echosounders. All NOAA FSVs and ships that have scientific echosounders collect data using the EK80. "EK80" refers to the echosounder (hardware that generates an electrical signal that is transmitted to the acoustic transducer and receives an electrical signal (voltage) that is then digitized and sent to the acquisition software, also known as "EK80". The EK80 has several echosounders that can be used. The shipboard echosounder is called a Wide-Band Transceiver (WBT), and portable units are WBT-Tubes or WBATs (Wide-Band Autonomous Transceivers).

### EK60

The [EK60](https://www.kongsberg.com/discovery/products/discontinued/simrad-ek60/) is the previous generation scientific echosounder. It was introduced in the late 1990s, and was installed on NOAA ships in the early 2000s. The majority of historic data collected by NOAA is from the EK60. The echosounder was called the General Purpose Transceiver (GPT) and the data acquisition software was called "ER60". The EK80 software can control both WBTs and GPTs. Which software, ER60 or EK80, recorded the data is important to distinguish because the digital format of the data are different depending on software version.

### EK500

The EK500 was used from the 1980s (1970s?) until the early 2000s on NOAA ships. More on this...
